# Get the packages:

git clone http://github.com/cpbl/cpblUtilities
git clone http://github.com/cpbl/pystata
git clone http://github.com/cpbl/cpbl_tables

and put them somewhere that is on your PYTHONPATH. For instance, maybe you have put the three folders in /home/user/bin/ 

# To put that folder on your PYTHONPATH, you could add the following line to your ~/.bashrc 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/bin/

Also install, through your operating system's python package manager, or in your local path, the python package "pandas". There may be some other standard packages that are needed too; let me know.

In the pystata module, you may need to edit pystata_core.py to update the values of 
stataexec so that it knows where to find your stata executable.

# Launch stata, and install the following two packages:

net describe zscore, from(http://www.stata.com/users/sdriver)
net install zscore
net describe gzsave, from(http://fmwww.bc.edu/RePEc/bocode/g)
net install gzsave

# Navigate to the cpbl_tables repository, and put the .sty files found there into your local TEX path. Then update the TEX file database (texhash)
# E.g., on GNU/Linux:

mkdir ~/texmf
mkdir ~/texmf/tex
cp cpbl_tables/*.sty ~/texmf/tex
texhash


Now choose some working folder that is not in /bin.
Copy the following files from pystata/demo to this new folder: pystata-demo.py and sample_data_BES.dta.gz
For instance:

cp ~/bin/pystata/demo/pystata-demo.py ~/bin/pystata/demo/*dta.gz ./

Also copy the config-template.cfg from pystata to config.cfg in the folder (Chosen above), and edit it to specify some paths (they should exist) for outputs. The paths should be absolute; ie they should start with '/'.
For instance:

cp ~/bin/pystata/config-template.cfg ./config.cfg
gedit config.cfg

# Then run the demo script, three times.


python ./pystata-demo.py
python ./pystata-demo.py
python ./pystata-demo.py

Now use your pdf viewer to look at:  texdocs/pystata-demo-2014-A.pdf
